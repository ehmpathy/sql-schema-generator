# Overview

`schema-generator` does two things for us:
- generates sql for "persisted entities" (both static and updatable) in relational databases, based on a declaritive definition of entities
  - i.e., it generates the following resources:
    - entity static table
    - entity version table (if updatable properties exist, for an insert-only / event-driven design, per temporal database design)
    - upsert stored procedure (for idempotent inserts)
    - a `_current` view, to abstract away the versioning pattern
    - a `_current_hydrated` view, to abstract away composition and reduce db queries
- encodes best practices
  - optimal data types
  - insert only (using temporal database design to maintain normalized tables and uniqueness constraints)
  - abstractions to simplify dealing with temporal database design schema (upsert sproc and _current view)
  - abstractions to simplify dealing with compositional relationships (_current_hydrated view)

Note: the user has complete flexibility to update the generated sql to suite any edge case - simply modify the generated, boiler-plate, best-practice sql generated by this util.

# Usage

1. Save the package as a dev dependency
  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev schema-generator
  ```

2. Declare your entities, somewhere in your VCS repo
  ```ts
  // for example: in <root>/schema/entities.ts

  import { Entity, prop } from 'schema-generator';

  const chat = new Entity({
    name: 'chat',
    properties: {
      room_uuid: prop.UUID(),
      started_date: {
        ...prop.DATETIME(6),
        updatable: true,
      },
    },
    unique: ['room_uuid'],
  });
  const message = new Entity({
    name: 'message',
    properties: {
      chat_id: prop.REFERENCES(chat),
      content: prop.TEXT(),
      user_uuid: prop.UUID(),
    },
    unique: ['chat_id', 'content', 'user_uuid'],
  });
  const like = new Entity({
    name: 'like',
    properties: {
      message_id: prop.REFERENCES(message),
      user_uuid: prop.UUID(),
    },
    unique: ['message_id', 'user_uuid'],
  });

  export const entities = [chat, message, like];
  ```

3. Run the generate command
  ```sh
  npx schema-generator generate -d schema/entities.ts -t schema/generated
  ```

4. Check the generated into your VCS
  - Steps 2 and 3 above will have produced tables, functions, and views for each entity, as required. For best practice, we encourage you to check these sql resources into your VCS. This will make it easy to detect changes in the source sql, if ever modified, and for peer reviews.

5. Use a schema management tool like schema-control or liquibase to apply your schema

# Contribution

Team work makes the dream work! Please create a ticket for any features you think are missing and, if willing and able, draft a PR for the feature :)

## Testing
1. start the integration test db
  - *note: you will need docker and docker-compose installed for this to work*
  - `npm run integration-test-provision-db`
2. run the tests
  - `npm run test`

## Test Coverage
Test coverage is essential for maintainability, readability, and ensuring everything works! Anything not covered in tests is not guarenteed to work.

Test coverage:
- proves things work
- immensely simplifies refactoring (i.e., maintainability)
- encourages smaller, well scoped, more reusable, and simpler to understand modules (unit tests especially)
- encourages better coding patterns
- is living documentation for code, guaranteed to be up to date

#### Unit Tests
Unit tests should mock out all dependencies, so that we are only testing the logic in the immediate test. If we are not mocking out any of the imported functions, we are 1. testing that imported function (which should have its own unit tests, so this is redundant) and 2. burdening ourselfs with the considerations of that imported function - which slows down our testing as we now have to meet those constraints as well.

Note: Unit test coverage ensures that each function does exactly what you expect it to do (i.e., guarentees the contract). Compile time type checking (i.e., typescript) checks that we are using our dependencies correctly. When combined together, we guarentee that the contract we addition + compile time type checking guarentee that not only are we using our dependencies correctly but that our dependencies will do what we expect. This is a thorough combination.

`jest`

#### Integration Tests
Integration tests should mock _nothing_ - they should test the full lifecycle of the request and check that we get the expected response for an expected input. These are great to use at higher levels of abstraction - as well at the interface between an api (e.g., db connection or client).

`jest -c jest.integration.config.js`

## Patterns

Below are a few of the patterns that this project uses and the rational behind them.

- TypedObjects: every logical entity that is worked with in this project is represented by a typed object in order to formally define a ubiquitous language and enforce its usage throughout the code
- Contract - Logic - Data: this module formally distinguishes the contract layer, the logic layer, and the data layer:
  - The contract layer defines what we expose to users and under what requirements. This is where any input validation or output normalization occurs. This is where we think about minimizing the amount of things we expose - as each contract is something more to maintain.
  - The logic layer defines the domain logic / business logic that this module abstracts. This is where the heart of the module is and is where the magic happens. This layer is used by the contract layer to fulfill its promises and utilizes the data layer to persist data.
  - The data layer is a layer of abstraction that enables easy interaction with data sources and data stores (e.g., clients and databases). This module only uses the database.
- Utils -vs- Abstracting Complexity: abstracting complexity is important for maintainability and also for well scoped unit tests. We distinguish, in this project, two types of abstractions:
  - _utils are for modules that are completely domain independent and could easily be their own node module.
  - Otherwise, the module/function that you are abstracting into its own function should be a sibling module to the main module, under a directory with the name of the main module.
